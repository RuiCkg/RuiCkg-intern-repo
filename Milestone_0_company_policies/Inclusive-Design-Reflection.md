# Working with Vulnerable Populations - Rui Chosa

## Research & Learn
### Who are considered vulnerable populations, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?
- **Who:** People aged under 18 or other individuals who may be unable to take care of themselves or are unable to protect themselves.
- **Challenges:** limited access to quality healthcare, inadequate/unsafe housing, social exclusion, lack of transportation, and, particularly during crises, high risks of exploitation, violence, and food insecurity. 

### What ethical considerations are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals? (Hint: Avoid overwhelming UX, respect sensory needs, ensure clear communication.)
- Making UI simple
- Modulate Environmental Stimuli
- Be Patient with Processing Time

### How can you make interactions and content more accessible for people with ADHD or Autism? (e.g., simple language, predictable navigation, reducing cognitive load)
- Use plain and clear language
- Reduce cognitive overload
- Ensure predictable navigation
- Minimize sensory overload

### How can we support neurodivergent team members in a professional setting? (Hint: Be clear in communication, respect different working styles, and allow flexibility.)
- Be clear in communication
- Be respectful and patient with them
- Provide sensory-friendly options

## Reflection
### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
I can use simple language and be clear about everything. I can be respectful and patient with thme when they need time.

### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
- Complicated UI
- Unclear language
- Lack of flexibility and userbility

### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
One practical change I can make is using clear and plain language. It conveys my thoughts and intentions clearly.

## Task
### Read a first-person account from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools. (Hint: Look for blog posts, videos, or community discussions.)
I read a "My Daily Work Routine and 4 Productivity Tools That Help Me Get Things Done" by Kate Arends with ADHD about their experience using productivity tools. 
One insight that stood out to me was when she described needing systems that “work with my brain instead of against it.” This made me realize that productivity tools should not force users into rigid structures.
Another meaningful point was how she relies on simple, consistent tools rather than complicated systems. She emphasized that too many features can create decision fatigue. That helped me understand why minimal design is especially important for users with ADHD.
This article changed my perspective because I previously thought adding more features makes a tool more powerful. Now I understand that for neurodivergent users, simplicity and flexibility are more valuable than complexity.

### Identify one design or communication improvement that could make Focus Bear more accessible.
I feel like there are lots of features which is overwhelming. If this app is suppose to be for neurodivergent individuals, it should be more simple and accesible for the users.
One design improvement would be simplifying the dashboard interface. Currently, there are multiple sections displayed at once, such as goals, habits, timers, analytics, and notifications. For someone with ADHD, seeing too many options immediately can create cognitive overload.
A concrete change would be introducing a “Focus Mode” that hides all non-essential features and shows only one active task at a time. Users could toggle between full view and simplified view depending on their needs. This would reduce visual clutter and make it easier to start tasks without feeling overwhelmed.

### Practice writing a clear, patient, and supportive response to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning.
I understand how frustrating executive functioning challenges can feel. It’s completely okay to struggle with starting tasks or staying focused, you’re not lazy or incapable.
Let’s break it down into something smaller. Instead of thinking about finishing the whole task, could we try just opening the document or working on it for 5 minutes? Often starting is the hardest part.
