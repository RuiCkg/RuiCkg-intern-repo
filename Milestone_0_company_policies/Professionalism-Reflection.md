# Professionalism at Focus Bear - Rui Chosa

## Research & Learn
### What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)
- **Communication:** clear, concise language vs unclear, fragmented messages
- **Meeting etiquette:** always being on time, well prepared, listening well when others speak vs being late, not prepared, not listening while others speak
- **Teamwork:** respect each members, be responsible for your tasks and deadlines vs not respect members, not be responsilbe for your tasks

### What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)
Professional communication means staying engaged in meeting for example, keeping your camera on and muting your microphone when you’re not speaking. For quick updates or questions, Discord can be used to send clear and courteous messages. If a conflict arises, I would reach out to the person directly through a private message on Discord to resolve the issue calmly instead of debating it in a public group channel.

### How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of reacting defensively)
When giving feedback, I aim to be respectful and constructive, using clear examples and assuming positive intent. When receiving it, I listen actively without getting defensive, ask clarifying questions when needed, and reflect objectively to take meaningful action.

## Reflection
### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
I have experienced great teamwork in one of units that I took last Semester. My team was always having meetings and nobody was late for the meetings. We followed the deadlines everytime and ended up getting great grades.

###  What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
Communicate with team members and organizers well, be on time, prepare well before meetings, and have thoughts and questions.

### How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
I would try to reach out them on Discord since this is the main platform that Focus Bear's team members use. If they don't respond in a couple of days, then I would email them or speak to them when I have a stand-up meeting.

### What are some things you won't do?
- I won't try to reach out them too much.
- Understanding when they are really busy to respond
