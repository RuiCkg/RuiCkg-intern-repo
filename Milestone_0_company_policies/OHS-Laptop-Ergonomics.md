- Taking a nap

## Reflection
### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)
- External monitor
- Chair is high enough that wrist and shoulders are relaxed

### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)
- Take a break regularly 
- Stretching regularly

### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)
Using Focus Bear

## Task
### Adjust your laptop setup based on ergonomic best practices.
I adjusted my moniter height to be at my eye level.

### Identify at least one piece of equipment that could improve your posture and comfort.
Adjustable chair: I don't have this one but I would like to get it one day if I have enough monoey.

### Try using posture and movement reminders for a full workday and note any improvements. (Hint: Focus Bear has built-in reminders for movement breaks!)
I used Quick Breaks (Stretch).

### Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made
I adjusted my moniter height to be at my eye level. I also started to take a 10 minutes break every time when I work on something.
