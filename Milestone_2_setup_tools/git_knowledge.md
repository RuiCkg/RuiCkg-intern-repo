# Set up git locally - Rui Chosa

## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes, I have. I used Git through my university courses.

## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I chose not to use Git client because official Git is enough since it includes a command-line interface and basic GUI.

## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
I learnt how Git works from local changes to pushing them to GitHub with the following commands:
git add, git commit, and git push.
