# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration - Rui Chosa
## Research & Learn
### What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
- *Daily Stand-ups:* 
    - A 15-minute daily meeting for team members to sync, discuss progress, and identify blockers. 
- *Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban):* 
    - The team defines the goal and selects items from the product backlog to complete.
    - Continuous prioritisation is deciding on priority of tasks and ensuring highest priority is done first
- *Retrospectives:*
    - Held at the end of a sprint, the team reflects on their process, tools, and relationships.
- *Backlog Refinement:*
    - An ongoing, often mid-sprint, meeting to review, size, and prioritize upcoming backlog items.

### How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
Teams can use tools like Jira and Slack for updates across different time zones.
